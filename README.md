rpostgrexplorer
===============

R package for PostgreSQL and Redshift metadata explorations


<h4> Motivation </h4>

Imagine the situation when you are given a poorly (or too-well) documented PostgreSQL-stored data to analyze.
Datatables lacks the constraints, some are empty or residual, all is a bit messy.
The **rpostgrexplorer** package is to help to navigate the analysis on the sea of the messy data.
